monitoring resources (memory, swap, CPU, Load, disk, critical kernel logs, network)
core functions:
- check if the services are up and running;
- time of response to the server and to the client;
- total amount of requests in the last hour(s) (1, 6, 12 and 24 hours);
- total amount of requests in the last 5 minutes;
- total amount of refused and dropped connections in the last hour and last 15 minutes (or less);
- total amount of active connections;
- total amount of memory usage and cpu used by the proxy process;
- check if the host is up or down;
- users connected with ssh in the server;
- check for log errors in the last 1 hour every minute;
- check the amount of handshakes;

In order to monitor resources like CPU and memory we can use the items included in the standard template of linux systems

- to check the errors and count all the requests, we can read the log with a grep using and expression to filter the date;

- for 500 like (type) errors we can read the log files and then utilize grep to filter and collect more information

- to check the response time we need to create an item with the key like for example net.tcp.service.perf and then use it to create the triggers;
